## Summary

- **Total icons available:** 559
- **Total icons generated:** 559
- **Total icons checked / optimized:** 2
- **Dual-mode icons (light + dark):** 131
- **Single-mode icons (light only):** 428

## Aliases

Some icons have aliases — alternate names that can be used to refer to the same icon.  
For example, if there is a **JavaScript** icon, the aliases allow a user to type **JS** or **java-script** and get the same icon.  
This makes it easier to use icons dynamically in TextStack or other systems.

## Notes

All icons are sourced from [SVGL](https://github.com/pheralb/svgl).

- To **add an icon**, you must submit it through the platform — this is the official source.
- To **remove an icon**, you must also do it through the platform. We only take icons from this platform.
